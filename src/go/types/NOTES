TODO
- satisfyBounds is not working correctly
- allow recursive type parameterization without need to repeat type parameters
- if type parameters are repeated in recursive instantiation, they must be the same order
- implement contract embedding
- interface embedding doesn't take care of literal type constraints yet
  (need an allTypes list, like we have an allMethods list?)
