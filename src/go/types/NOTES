TODO
- satisfyBounds is not working correctly
- allow recursive type parameterization without need to repeat type parameters
- if type parameters are repeated in recursive instantiation, they must be the same order
- implement contract embedding
- interface embedding doesn't take care of literal type constraints yet
  (need an allTypes list, like we have an allMethods list?)


OPEN ISSUES
- incorrect constraint errors:

package p

contract B(T) {
	T int
}

type T(type P B) P

func f(type P B)(x T(P)) // this should be valid


DESIGN DECISIONS
- 12/4/2019: do not allow parenthesized generic uninstantiated types (unless instantiated implicitly)
  In other words: generic types must always be instantiated before they can be used in any form
  More generally: Only permit type instantiation T(x) in type context, when the type is a named type.
  Do not permit in in general in type context: e.g., disallow []T(x) because we consider that a
  conversion, in general. Same for ([]T)(x).
